# Description: Let the robot now find
# the white spot. If there is a beacon
# in front: eat it up!

# Challenge: Use repeat{...} and
# if(.){} else if (.){}, eatUp and 
# else{}. Do NOT count, no sequencing!

# Solution:

repeat
{
	# 1. The robot sees the
	# beacon. Complete:
	if(frontIsWhite)
	{
		forward
		end
	}

	# 2. The robot sees a
	# beacon.
	else if(frontIsBeacon)
	{
		eatUp
	}

	# 2. What to do when there
	# is no wall to the right:
	else if (rightIsClear)
	{
		right
		forward(1)
	}

	# 3. What to do when there
	# is something in front:
	else if (frontIsObstacle)
	{
		left
	}
	
	# 4. What to do otherwise
	# while not at the beacon:
	else
	{
		forward(1)
	}
}
