# Description: Adjust your 
# program to let Robo also 
# paint this much larger floor 
# with a checkerboard pattern.

# Challenge: the floor is not
# square anymore! Solve by
# splitting horizontal and vertical
# lines with own parameters, OR use
# condition: while (frontIsClear){...}

# solution:

# go to start
backward(6)
right
backward(9)

#horizontal stripes
repeat(13)
{
	# paint a stripe
	paintWhite
	forward(18)

	# go back
	stopPainting
	backward(18)

	# go to a new position
	left
	forward(1)
	right
}

#vertical stripes
right
repeat(19)
{
	# paint a stripe
	paintWhite
	forward(12)

	# go back
	stopPainting
	backward(12)

	# go to a new position
