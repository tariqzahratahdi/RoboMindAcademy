# Description: Let the robot 
# use a combination of white
# and black dots to find the
# beacon.

# Challenge: Use repeat(.){...}
# and if(.){}else if(.){} else{}
# and double conditions: if (A and B){}

# Solution:

repeat
{
	# 1. Do this when there
	# is a beacon in front:
	if(frontIsBeacon)
	{
		pickUp
		end
	}
	
	# 2. Do this when there
	# is a white dot front AND left:
	else if(frontIsWhite and leftIsWhite)
	{
		left
		forward(1)
	}
	
	# 3. Do this when there
	# is a white dot front AND right:
	else if(frontIsWhite and rightIsWhite)
	{
		right
		forward(1)
	}
	# 4. Do this otherwise:
