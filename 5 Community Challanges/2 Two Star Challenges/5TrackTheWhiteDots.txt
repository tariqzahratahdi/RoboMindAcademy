# Description: Let the robot use the white dots 
# to find the beacon. 

# Challenge: Use repeat(.){...} and 
# conditions with if(.){...} else{...}. 
# Use frontIsWhite to test for a white dot.

# Think carefully what the robot should do 
# when he gets to the beacon!

# solution: 

repeat()

    if (frontIsBeacon)

        right
